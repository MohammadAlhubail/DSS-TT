          The official rulebook for table tennis, also known as ping pong, is
          maintained by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). The
          current version of the rulebook, which came into effect on September
          1, 2021, can be found on the ITTF website.

          <strong>
            Here are some of the most important rules in table tennis</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          1. The game is played on a table that is 2.74 meters long, 1.525
          meters wide, and 76 cm high. The table is divided into two halves by a
          net that is 15.25 cm high.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          2. The ball must be made of celluloid and must be a standard size and
          weight.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          3. A game is played to 11 points, and a player must win by a two-point
          margin.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          4. The serve must start with the ball resting on the open palm of the
          server's hand and must be thrown up at least 16 cm. The ball must then
          hit the server's half of the table, cross the net, and land on the
          receiver's half of the table.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          5. The rally continues until a player fails to return the ball
          correctly, hits the ball out of bounds, or commits a fault.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          6. Points can be scored by either player, and the player who scores a
          point serves for the next point.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par1">
          7. A player can change their playing hand during a match, but they
          must inform the umpire and their opponent before doing so.
        </p>
        <p class="rules-par">
          These are just some of the most important rules in table tennis, and
          the ITTF rulebook goes into much greater detail on how the game should
          be played. I would recommend reviewing the full rulebook if you are
          interested in playing the game competitively.
